## R code designed to calculate and cache the inverse of a matrix
## Composed of two functions - makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve 

## makeCacheMatrix will create a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve will compute the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix.
## If the inverse has already been calculated, then cacheSolve should retrive the inverse from cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
